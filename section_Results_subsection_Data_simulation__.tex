\section{Results}

\subsection{Data simulation}
An example of simulated data without covariates is depicted in Fig.[1].\\
The simulations of BSmooth \cite{23034175} and the WGBSSuite \cite{25777524} were used for comparison.\\
What do we see? Did we expect that?

\subsection{Differential methylation on simulated data}
Simulated data: Chisq-test vs. F-test, overdispersion vs. no overdispersion.

\subsection{Differential methylation on real data}
Results of real data: Overdispersion control vs. no overdispersion control.\\
Comparison to CTCF / H3K9ac markers as biological / functional "control".\\
Do we see a peak-loss? If so, what percentage?
