\section{(Materials and) Methods}

Experimental data (work in progress)

Analysis methods: GLM (logistic model) to discern between treatment and covariate effect. 
Overdispersion control.

Data Simulation methods: Binomial distribution simulates background methylation. 
Betabinomial distribution maps this to actual percentages.
Logistic function to simulate influence of numeric covariate (i.e. age) on methylation percentages for individual CpG sites.
